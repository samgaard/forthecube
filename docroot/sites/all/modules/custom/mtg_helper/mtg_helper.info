All this stuff is taken care of by the plugin and that's not the enf of it. MtG-Helper does not only link cards for you it also creates good looking deck lists, sealed pools and booster drafts. The only thing you have to do is typ in the cards. If you still not convinced, take a look at the screenshots."
